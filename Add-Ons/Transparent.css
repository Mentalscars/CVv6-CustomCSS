/*
THIS ADDON SHOULD WORK WITH ALL OPERATING SYSTEMS.
THIS ADDON WILL ONLY WORK WITH SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS DISCORD TO BE TRANSPARENT.
USING BANDAGEDBD, ENABLE "Enable Transparency" UNDER THE BANDAGEDBD SETTINGS.
IT IS ADVICED NOT TO CHANGE THEME/MODE (light mode/dark mode) OR OPEN THE DEV TOOLS WITH THIS ADDON ACTIVE.
ONCE THE SETTING IS ENABLED, YOU SHOULD HARD RESTART DISCORD BY CLOSING IT AND REOPENING IT.

TO USE; PUT THE FOLLOWING LINE IN YOUR CUSTOM CSS.
@import url(https://leafyluigi.github.io/CVv6-CustomCSS/Add-Ons/Transparent.css);
